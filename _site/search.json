      "contents": "\r\nOne will potential encounter heterogeneous data sets where one has to analysis, combines and associate. The task is exacerbated when the dataset has geospatial-temporal with timeseries attributes. Ability to discern and process the data to gain insight is a daunting task. Referencing to mini challenge 2 in 2021 VAST challenge, the motivation for is to provide DiGTvis, dynamic and interactive geospatial temporal visualisation dashboard. The dashboard shall design with principals of visualisation and usability, centric around the needs of a user. We have demonstrated the potential of DiGTvis in exploring and analysing heterogeneous data. Most importantly, the exponential values and insights that DiGTvis could offer when leveraging on few essential visualisation toolkits couple with highly interactive design.\r\nA short description of not more than 350 word summarising the motivation, objectives, main features of the application your team are going to build.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It has a variety of realistic analytic tasks and data sets for one to challenge their mind and skillsets. When solving the task, It will spur one to be innovative in data transformation and the application of visual analytic techniques so to develop insightful, interesting and interactive visualisation. VAST Challenge 2021 is here. The challenge will set the foundation and opportunity for SMU students to test and benchmark one visual analytics technique.\r\nMOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES\r\nWe are motivated and honoured to pit our visual analytics techniques on this renowned VAST Challenge by adopting this programme as the foundation for our Visual Analytics Project. We are fascinated to solve the tasks using creative and innovative visualisation for storytelling to the best of our ability. The objectives are:\r\nEffective use of visual analytics techniques in approaching and solving the tasks.\r\nOffer insightful interesting and interactive visualisation with good clarity and aesthetics as part of storytelling in solving the task.\r\nDATA AND TASKS\r\nThis project will focus on the mini-challenge 2 (MC2) from VAST Challenge 2021. It was designed based on a fictitious scenario where employee of a company went missing. And the data cover from loyalty card and credit card date to the vehicle GPS data:\r\nA list of vehicle assignments by employee, in CSV format (car-assignments.csv)\r\nEmployee Last Name\r\nEmployee First Name\r\nCar ID (integer)\r\nCurrent Employment Type (Department; categorical)\r\nCurrent Employment Title (job title; categorical)\r\n\r\nESRI shapefiles of Abila and Kronos (in the Geospatial folder)\r\nA CSV file of vehicle tracking data (gps.csv)\r\nTimestamp\r\nCar ID (integer)\r\nLatitude\r\nLongitude\r\n\r\nA CSV file containing loyalty card transaction data (loyalty_data.csv)\r\nTimestamp\r\nLocation (name of the business)\r\nPrice (real)\r\nLoyalty Number (A 5-character code starting with L that is unique for each card)\r\n\r\nA CSV file containing credit and debit card transaction data (cc_data.csv)\r\nTimestamp\r\nLocation (name of the business)\r\nPrice (real)\r\nLast 4 digits of the credit or debit card number\r\n\r\nA tourist map of Abila with locations of interest identified, in JPEG format (MC2-Tourist.jpg)\r\nBased on the available datasets, we will complete several tasks:\r\nIdentify popular locations where the credit and loyalty card were used and some anomalies in usage\r\nAnomalies after adding the vehicle data\r\nInfer the owners of each credit and loyalty card and with evidence and uncertainties\r\nIdentify potential informal or unofficial relationships among personnel in the company\r\nIdentify suspicious activity and its location\r\nAPPROACH\r\nThis year, the project is a continuation for the module assignment where individual teammate will independently select one mini challenge to embark on. Thereafter, the teammate will decide collectively on the project deliverables base on the assignment. For the project, the teammate will meet up based on the established timeline to share about their works to address the MC2 tasks.\r\nThrough collective discussion, we would either select the best visualisation from individual effort on the respective task or design a new visualisation based on new insights gleaned from the discussion. The discussion will also focus on deliberating on the best approach to storytelling team findings via an interactive visualisation in Shinny. Aim is to provide positive experience to one in exploring insights via Shinny. The details on the techniques and visualisation will evolve over the assignment phase.\r\nSoftware Tool\r\nThis interactive application will be using R and the final report will be written using rmarkdown.\r\nThe R packages used will include but not limited to:\r\nData Cleaning\r\nlubridate: https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/\r\nTidyverse: https://www.tidyverse.org/\r\nGeneral\r\nreadr: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr\r\nreadxl: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl\r\ntidyverse: https://www.tidyverse.org\r\nShiny and Visualization\r\nDT: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT\r\nggplot2: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html\r\nshiny: https://shiny.rstudio.com\r\nshinythemes: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinythemes\r\nshinyWidgets: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyWidgets\r\nshinydashboard: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinydashboard/index.html\r\nData Analysis\r\ncorrplot: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot\r\npurr: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/purrr/index.html\r\nrgdal: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal\r\nrgeos: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgeos\r\nTIMELINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
